# Serverless User Management API (AWS Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB)

This project implements a fully serverless user management system using AWS services. It provides endpoints to register users, authenticate them with JWT, and retrieve user information ‚Äî all secured and scalable using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Stack

- **AWS Lambda** ‚Äì Runs the business logic (user registration, login, info retrieval)
- **Amazon API Gateway** ‚Äì RESTful API for accessing Lambda functions
- **Amazon DynamoDB** ‚Äì Stores user data
- **JWT Authentication** ‚Äì Secure access to protected endpoints
- **AWS CloudFormation** ‚Äì Infrastructure as code (IaC)
- **Postman** ‚Äì API testing collection included

---

## üìÅ Features

- `POST /register` ‚Äì Register new users with hashed passwords
- `POST /login` ‚Äì Authenticate and receive JWT token
- `GET /user-info` ‚Äì Retrieve user data (JWT required)
- Built-in error handling and basic input validation
- One-command deployment with `deploy.sh`

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/serverless-user-api.git
cd serverless-user-api
```

### 2. Set Up AWS CLI

Install AWS CLI and configure credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

### 3. Create S3 Bucket

Create a bucket to store Lambda code zips:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://your-unique-bucket-name
```

Update `deploy.sh` with your bucket name.

### 4. Deploy

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

This will:
- Zip and upload Lambda functions
- Deploy full infrastructure using CloudFormation
- Print your API Gateway URL

---

## üîê JWT Authentication

After a successful login, you'll receive a JWT token:

```json
{
  "token": "<your.jwt.token>"
}
```

Use it in the `Authorization` header for protected requests:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your.jwt.token>
```

---

## üß™ Testing with Postman

Import the included Postman collection from:

```
postman/user-management-api.postman_collection.json
```

Or test manually:

```bash
# Register
curl -X POST https://<API_URL>/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"john","password":"SecurePass9","email":"john@example.com"}'

# Login
curl -X POST https://<API_URL>/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"john","password":"SecurePass9"}'

# Get User Info
curl -X GET https://<API_URL>/user-info \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your.token>"
```

### üß® Cleanup Script

To delete all resources created by this project (CloudFormation stack, Lambdas, DynamoDB, API Gateway) and clean up S3 zip files.
Update `destroy.sh` with your bucket name.
 
Run:

```bash
chmod +x destroy.sh
./destroy.sh
```

This will:
- Delete the CloudFormation stack `user-management-api`
- Wait for the deletion to complete
- Remove all Lambda zip files from `s3://your-unique-bucket-name/lambda-code/`

---

## üîí Security Notes

- In the current setup, JWT tokens are verified directly inside each Lambda function (e.g., `getUserInfo`).
- For better scalability and separation of concerns, you could use a **Lambda Authorizer** in API Gateway in the future. This would allow centralized token validation and reduce duplicate logic across functions.


- Passwords are hashed using `bcryptjs`
- JWT is signed with a secret stored in environment variables
- In production, use AWS SSM or Secrets Manager for managing secrets like `JWT_SECRET`
